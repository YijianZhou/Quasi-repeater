# Quasi-repeater  
Detection of repeating and quasi-repeating earthquakes.  

## Installation  
Quasi-repeater is a set of codes. All you need is to setup proper Python environment. This can be accomplished easily by installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads), [Obspy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki/Installation-via-Anaconda), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) sequentially.
